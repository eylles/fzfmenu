# wot?

This is a dmenu compatible using fzf and your favourite terminal, the idea is to support most of the
options that vanilla dmenu does but not all will be honored or supported.


## why tho?

Autism, why else.

But for real fzf can do i say all that dmenu can plus the previews and a couple other fancy things.


## TODO


- [ ] fix the jank
- [ ] add a dedicated fzf wrapper to have images with ueberzug or sixel
- [ ] write a fzfmenu-run script to imitate dmenu
- [ ] port ~steal~ features from [term-menu](https://github.com/Seirdy/term-dmenu)
- [ ] port ~steal~ the providers feature from [sway-launcher](https://github.com/Biont/sway-launcher-desktop)
